## üöÄ Installation Details

### Self-Contained Deployment
This application includes the .NET 8 runtime, so no additional software is required. The total package size is approximately 160 MB but provides complete independence from system dependencies.

### Hotkey Registration
The application automatically tries to register these hotkeys in order:
1. `Print Screen` (most common)
2. `Ctrl+Shift+F12` (fallback)

If both fail, you can still capture screenshots via the system tray icon.

### Common Hotkey Conflicts
If hotkey registration fails, it's usually because these applications are using Print Screen:
- OneDrive (Microsoft cloud storage)
- Microsoft Teams
- Other screenshot tools
- Gaming software (Discord, Steam, etc.)

The application will automatically use the fallback hotkey or inform you to use the system tray.
