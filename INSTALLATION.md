2. **Build the application**: Run `build.ps1` or `build.bat`
3. **Create installer**: Run `ISCC.exe BlueshotInstaller.iss`
4. **Distribute**: Share `installer/Blueshot-Setup-v1.0.0.exe`

### Method 2: Manual Installation

3. **Run**: Extract and run `Blueshot.exe` anywhere

## User Experience

### First Launch
1. Application starts minimized to system tray
2. Shows balloon tip: "Blueshot is running in the system tray. Press Print Screen to capture."
3. Global Print Screen hotkey is registered

### Daily Usage

2. **System Tray**: Double-click for quick capture, right-click for menu
3. **Annotations**: Professional toolbar with all tools available
4. **Background Operation**: Runs silently without interfering with other apps

### System Tray Menu

- Exit

## Technical Details

### Global Hotkey Implementation
- Uses Windows API `RegisterHotKey` and `UnregisterHotKey`
- Registers VK_SNAPSHOT (Print Screen) without modifiers
- Processes WM_HOTKEY messages in main form's WndProc
- Properly cleans up on application exit

### System Tray Integration
- NotifyIcon with context menu
- Balloon tips for user feedback
- Hide instead of close behavior
- Professional tray icon

### Memory Footprint
- Lightweight: ~30-50MB RAM usage
- No background scanning or heavy processes
- Only activates when Print Screen is pressed

## Distribution Checklist

### For End Users
- [ ] .NET 8 Desktop Runtime installed
- [ ] Windows 10 version 1809 or later
- [ ] Administrator rights for initial hotkey registration (handled automatically)

### For Developers
- [ ] Visual Studio 2022 or .NET 8 SDK
- [ ] Inno Setup (for installer creation)
- [ ] Code signing certificate (optional, for trusted installation)

## Security Considerations

### Antivirus Detection
- Global hotkey registration may trigger antivirus warnings
- Code signing recommended for distribution
- Whitelist application in corporate environments

### Windows SmartScreen
- Unsigned executables may show warnings
- Consider Authenticode signing for wider distribution
- Users can click "More info" â†’ "Run anyway"

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Custom hotkey configuration
- [ ] Settings panel with preferences
- [ ] Multiple capture modes (full screen, window)
- [ ] Cloud integration (OneDrive, Google Drive)
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Self-contained deployment option
- [ ] Modern packaging (MSIX)
- [ ] Windows Store distribution
- [ ] Digital signature

## Support Information

### System Requirements
- Windows 10 (1809+) / Windows 11

### Troubleshooting
- **Print Screen not working**: Check if other apps are using the hotkey. Blueshot will show a warning if registration fails.
