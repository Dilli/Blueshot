# Icon Placeholder
# Create a 48x48 pixel icon file named "icon.ico" in the project directory.
# This icon will be used for:
# - Application icon
# - System tray icon
# - Installer icon
# - File associations (if any)

# You can use online tools like:
# - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
# - https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
# - Or use GIMP, Paint.NET, or similar tools

# Recommended sizes to include in the ICO file:
# - 16x16
# - 32x32
# - 48x48
# - 256x256

# For now, the application will use SystemIcons.Application as fallback
